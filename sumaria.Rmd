## WHAT IF

???


The image on left side is Sumaria Tr. (Probable) site for an aquaculture project.

!!To go to map use 20+ENTER

Before we begin. Why the Why? The short answer is:

!!! To satisfy your vision (of creating wealth for the ages)
Think of the Nutrina Farms example

!!! EACH: Prepare a vision for EFE for coming 36 mths, extend it to 60 and then to 120 mths. I will suggest you also for your Ownself as the company is nothing on its own. The core values will eventually emanate from this exercise

## PRAWN FARMING?

.pull-left[
**Why not**?

  - Aquaculture is doable (Funds allowing) 
  - Prawn is exportable good 
  - Outlay compares favourably to class of businesses
  - Buy-in is scalable (start with local sales) 
  - Farming is a trans-generational business
  - Farming addresses food security

The shrimp in the image is a blue claw Macrobrachium rosenbergii.
Regarding the "is food" comment. Is an SD Goal 2 Zero Hunger. 
The project is not limited to a single species.

## GUIDING THE VISION

<h3>SUSTAINABILITY however</h3>
 
 should always be the true **GOAL**


???

Define the EFE take on Sustainability. 
Think of this as creating Generational Wealth [Life Insurance]
but it is also good CSR   (doing well by doing good - the triple bottom line (ESG) value system )

## TRY FOR A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS

 Explanation of the Diagram:
 
 1. **Site Selection & Preparation**: Choosing a suitable location and preparing the farm.
 2. **Shrimp Procurement**: Sourcing healthy juvenile shrimp. Buy initially / grow stock from there on
 3. **Growth & Management**: Monitoring shrimp growth and maintaining water quality.
 4. **Harvesting**: Collecting shrimp at the optimal size.
 5. **Processing & Packaging**: Cleaning and packaging shrimp for sale.
 6. **Market Research & Strategy**: Identifying target markets and developing marketing strategies.
 7. **Sales & Distribution**: Establishing sales channels and distributing the product.
 8. **Customer Relations**: Building relationships with customers and addressing feedback.

The European Community market and the United Kingdom are accessible under the Economic Partnership Agreement. Canada is accessible under Investment Protection Agreement. Not forgetting the CARICOM market

  <li><b>Unreliable</b></li>

## LABOUR FORCE SOLUTIONS

<ul>
  <li>the basic wage candidate,</li>
  <li>the migrant community,</li>
  <li>the expat workforce</li>
  <li>family members</li>

.pull-right[**In our favour T&T**
<ul>
<li>must improve the fiscal float,</li>
<li>must innovate (<i>to enable job creation</i>)</li>
<li>must beat criminal activity</li>
</ul>
]

???

The point being - we can tap into that large pool of unskilled, youth and migrant labour 
and solve some of the country issues as well by creating jobs

Probably Indian expat workers.

## MARKET PRICE

.pull-left[

|Market [R-F]|Price (Kg)|Year| 
|:---|:---|:---|
|CA|$8.63 US|2024|  
|UK|$9.12 US|2024|
|EU|$6.90 US|2024|

Trini (local) market is a good enough jump-off point but the CA, UK, and EU freshwater shrimp market is the goal.

The typical freshwater shrimp import into CA, UK and EU is Raw-Frozen (R-F) and Value-Added Processed (V-A P).
]

.pull-right[


Shrimp price in Trinidad varies acc. to type and market conditions. Hereâ€™s current prices:

- **Retail Price Range**: 
  - Between **TTD 24.20** and **TTD 54.86** per kilogram.

- **Market Highlights**:
  - Prices can fluctuate based on availability and demand, with some reports indicating prices ranging from **$5.68 USD** to **$14.32 USD** per kilogram.

These prices can vary by location, with Port of Spain and Chaguanas being the notable markets. 

]  

???

the average price across the 3 currencies in 2024 was $8.22 /  just FYI.
If exported. Same yield nets US$16,500

The average yield for a tropical freshwater prawn farm can vary based on several factors, including management practices, water quality, and stocking density. However, here are some general insights:

1. **Average Yield Range**: 
   - Yields typically range from **600 to 1,200 pounds per acre**. Since 1 hectare is approximately **2.47 acres**, this translates to about **1,482 to 2,645 pounds per hectare**.
   - For a **2.5 hectare** pond, this would mean an average yield of approximately:
     - **3,705 to 6,612 pounds** (or about **1,680 to 3,000 kg**).

2. **Stocking Density**: 
   - Many producers use a semi-intensive stocking density of about **15,000 to 18,000 prawns per acre**.

3. **Harvest Time**: 
   - Prawns generally reach marketable size in about **4 to 5 months**, with average sizes at harvest being around **25-35 grams**.

These figures can vary based on specific farming practices and environmental conditions. 

Back to EFE. Estimated shrimp output (@Sumaria and using a conservative 50% yield of type R-F is 2000kg per 3 hectare, per 9 mth rotation. Note, the average yield for established farms is >70% 

If sold at $50 per kg in T&T, 2000 Kgs grosses TT$100,000 every 9 months

## EASE OF DOING BUSINESS INDEX


.pull-left[**Fostering economic growth is Difficult**. 

Due to: ]
.pull-right[

<ol>
  <li> low productivity in workforce</li>  
  <li> corruption across the board</li>
  <li> poor compliance documentation </li>
  <li> excessive trade sector paperwork </li>
  <li> onerous bureaucracy that hinders compliance </li>
  <li> foreign exchange is ever the challenge </li>
  <li> praedial larceny</li>
  <li> birds</li>
  </ol> 
]

???

Crime is an expected issue but can be managed. Discuss robbery, praedial larceny.

Keep in mind these issues may be present in UK, Europe and now the USA

## CLIMATE CHANGE

.left-column[Sumaria Farms faces an adverse climate. To offset this we need to have  

  - a resilient project
  - with optimal turnover cycles
  - scale]

.right-column[Perversely. Climate Change itself provides Opportunity and Impetus. Like;

  - Finance
  - Labour ]


???

Discuss incentivisation. 
Scale (as part of the overall business plan)
Ethical product marketing etc

Short turnover means shrimp grow out period.

## What shrimp farming looks like

'Root' is the raw material. Talk about the end product. Allow 4 mins for viewing. Give it the ole SUMARIA 2 minute pitch afterward

## About that prawn

.left-column[
![](https://bb2485.s3.us-east-005.dream.io/macrobrachium_rosenbergii.jpg)
]
.right-column[
Freshwater prawns (*Macrobrachium rosenbergii*) are a tropical species of shrimp native to Malaysia. With cultural acceptance, technical support and marketing infrastructure now in place, it is a local food business option.  

According to the [FAO Feed and Information System webpage](https://www.fao.org/fishery/affris/species-profiles/giant-river-prawn/giant-river-prawn-home/en/) it is nocturnal, will eat living things and is very territorial. 

]

???

crayfish in US = prawn in  UK.

The territorial trait is a boon - annual flooding presents no pain if perimeter is secured and in any case the onset of rainy season means our pond based prawns are mature.

What's the core premise about?

---
## REHASH

We are embarking on a feasibility study for an aquaculture project - likely at Sumaria Trace where it meets the mangrove. The project could consider freshwater prawn as a sole product or as part of a polyculture - like the IMA did with cascadura and the Malaysian prawn.  



???

Guppies as shrimp food 
Tilapia as alternative product? 
Sadiq Baksh may be an asset to bring in government help. Maybe - discuss this.
